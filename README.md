# random-messages
A quick Codecademy project to highlight some basic JavaScript skills I've learned through their full-stack course.

As part of my full-stack project with Codecademy, I was tasked with producing a random Node-based sentence generator. To do this, I utilised a 
generateRandomNumber() function and generateRandomSentence() function. The first function generates a random number based upon the length of the array parameter
passed in to it, and generateRandomSentence() then calls these functions and puts together a template literal string which denotes a random nonsense sentence.

To run the script, you need to navigate to the directory and call 'node script.js'.
